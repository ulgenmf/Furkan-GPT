# Furkan-GPT

An advanced chat bot with OpenAI-API. I am not really satisfied with the UI part of it but I dont  want to steal  UI ideas from other people. It has some disabled  features that I might get back to it but for  now I am going to work learning another tech

Lets try it out

This really basic react with VITE. 



First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install 

or 
yarn install 
or 
pnpm  install
```

then to run the development server:
```bash
 npm run dev

yarn dev
